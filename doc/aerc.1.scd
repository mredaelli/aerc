# NAME

aerc - the world's best email client

# SYNOPSIS

_aerc_ [-v]

For a guided tutorial, use *:help tutorial* from aerc, or *man aerc-tutorial*
from your terminal.

# OPTIONS

*-v*
	Prints the installed version of aerc and exits.

# RUNTIME COMMANDS

To execute a command, press ':' to bring up the command interface. Commands may
also be bound to keys, see *aerc-config*(5) for details. In some contexts, such
as the terminal emulator, '<c-x>' is used to bring up the command interface.

Different commands work in different contexts, depending on the kind of tab you
have selected.

Aerc stores a history of commands, which can be cycled through in command mode.
Pressing the up key cycles backwards in history, while pressing down cycles
forwards.

## GLOBAL COMMANDS

These commands work in any context.

*cd* <directory>
	Changes aerc's current working directory.

*change-tab* [+|-]<tab name or index>
	Changes the focus to the tab with the given name. If a number is given,
	it's treated as an index. If + or - is specified, the number is interpreted
	as a delta from the selected tab.

*exec* <command...>
	Executes an arbitrary command in the background.

	*Note*: commands executed in this way are not executed with the shell.

*pwd*
	Displays aerc's current working directory in the status bar.

*set* <category>.<option> <value>
	Changes the value of a configuration paramter at runtime. The category is
	the name of the [heading] for the config option you wish to change, and the
	option is the name of the config option. For example, to change this option:

	\[ui]++
	index-format=before

	Use :set ui.index-format after.

*term* [command...]
	Opens a new terminal tab with a shell running in the current working
	directory, or the specified command.

*prev-tab* [n], *next-tab* [n]
	Cycles to the previous or next tab in the list, repeating n times
	(default: 1).

*quit*
	Exits aerc.
